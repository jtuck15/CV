# **Online CV**

## *This is a quick mockup CV*

> I have built this website using the following:
> - HTML
> - CSS
> - Bootstrap

This website has a mobile first approach as nearly everyone uses their mobile phones to access the internet nowadays.

> *It includes:*
> 1. A Home page with my personal info and an about me section.
> 2. A Resume page with a work history and skills section.
> 3. A Contact page where you can submit a project request to me.
> 4. A Download button in which you can download a pdf version of my CV.

I will be updating this website again with all of my necessary details and as my skills progress, I will be adding JavaScript functionality.
